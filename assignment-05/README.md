I used the Wayback Machine to look at the difference between the Food Network website from 2013 compared to today. The main difference I saw was the layout that was used and how the design has changed. In 2013 they featured their shows on the homepage and drew focus to what was happening on the actual channel. This is different from todays, being as now they have many recipes, fun resturants to travel to, and only a few things about their shows on the homepage. The website looks more modern, and has everything split up more into categories, which makes using the website a lot eaiser. It seems to be more user friendly today, less cluttered and self-explanitory.
