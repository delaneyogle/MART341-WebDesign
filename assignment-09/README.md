When it comes to HTMLs, I knew nothing about them going into this class, so everything was new to me. It was very interesting seeing how to make different pages with this formula though, giving us different pages easily. The foramtes can be difficult to learn, but through practice and using resources it became somewhat easier.

I am very excited to find ways to make the HTMLs more "me". It would be very cool to find ways to put my own touch into the websites.
